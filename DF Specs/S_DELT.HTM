<P>
A DELT LFD resource codes a static image. <BR>
They are generally used as backgrounds for ANIMs, but their most important use is in the briefings 'texts' (the scrollable section of the briefing screen) which are a DELT stored in dfbrief.lfd for each level.
<P>

Note: the .dlt extension is a convention adopted by add-on developers when writing conversion programs, there are no real DLT files in DARK FORCES.

After the header, a variable number of <STRONG>line descriptors</STRONG> follow.<BR>
They are composed of an header and some data.

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=600><TR><TD><PRE>
DELT_Line
{
 SizeAndType      int              // size and compression of the line
 StartX           int              // X position of line start
 StartY           int              // Y position of line start
}

<P>

StartX and StartY indicate the point where to start the drawing. You can start in the middle of a line, and draw a portion of it. Lines need not be in consequential order. You can split one line in more than one section. Portions not covered are, of course, transparent.
<P>

Bits 1-15 of SizeAndType indicate the number of pixels described in this section.
<P>

If bit 0 of SizeAndType is 0, the byte following the header contains the number of bytes to copy.<BR>
Those bytes follow.
<P>

If bit 0 is 1, data compressed with RLE follows.<BR>
This data may be composed of copy and RLE parts, which is indicated by <STRONG>bit 0</STRONG> of the count byte.
